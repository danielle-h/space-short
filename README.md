## Issues
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/danielle-h/space-short/issues/new) if you've found a bug or want a feature.

## Code
Code will soon be uploaded. Note that becasue of Unity Store license restrictions, the code will not include 3rd party assets and therefore **will not run out of the box**. There is a full list of the assets used [here](https://danielle-honig.com/space-short-credits/). At the time of publication they were all free. You can add them or any other asset in order to run the code.
